<p>FUZZY /HELP  prints this output and does nothing else.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="example"><code>FUZZY DEMANDERDS=demand SUPPLIERDS = supply BY=agegroup gender
SUPPLIERID = id NEWDEMANDERIDVARS=supplierId.
</code></pre>

<p>Example using a single input dataset (the active dataset):</p>

<pre class="example"><code>FUZZY by=x1 supplierid = id newdemanderidvars=sid group=group
drawpoolsize=drawpool.
</code></pre>


<pre class="example"><code>FUZZY DEMANDERDS=demander SUPPLIERDS=supplier
BY=origin cylinder SUPPLIERID=id
NEWDEMANDERIDVARS=matchedcaseid
COPYTODEMANDER=mpg randomnumber randomstring
DS3=dsextra DEMANDERID=demanderid.
</code></pre>

<p>FUZZY takes two datasets, a demander and a supplier or a single dataset with a 
group identification variable.  It attempts to find a match for each
demander case from the supplier dataset based on the variables named in BY.  If more than one 
candidate matches, it picks randomly.  No sorting of either dataset is required.</p>

<p>If using a single dataset, the <strong>DEMANDERDS</strong> and <strong>SUPPLIERDS</strong> keywords
can be omitted.  The active dataset will be used.</p>

<p>By default, a match is defined by identical values for all the <strong>BY</strong> variables.  A system-missing
value prevents a case from being matched.  Fuzzy matching is also available for numeric variables.
Specify FUZZ=list-of-matching tolerances.  There must be one fuzz value for each BY variable,
listed in BY-value order.</p>

<p>A tolerance is the maximum difference in either direction that is allowed for a match.  Thus,
values of 1 and 2 would match if tolerance is 1 or more, and a tolerance of zero means an
exact match on that variable.  You must use 0 for any string variable.  If <strong>FUZZ</strong> is used,
rejection counts for each variable are show in the output.</p>

<p><strong>CUSTOMFUZZ</strong> can be used to substitute a user-written calculation for the
built-in fuzzy calculation.  It should specify a Python module name and function
as a quoted string, e.g. &quot;mymodule.fuzzycalc&rdquo;.  The function should return</p>

<ul>
<li>0 - no match</li>
<li>1- fuzzy match.</li>
<li>It could also return 2 (exact match).</li>
</ul>

<p>If the case comparison produced an exact match, this function is not called.
The function signature should be
<code>functionname(demander, supplier)</code><br/>
where demander and supplier are lists of the BY variable values for the
demander and supplier cases.
Note that the function needs to deal with missing values (None) and may
need to handle both string and numeric comparisons.
The FUZZ subcommand is ignored if a customfuzz function is used.</p>

<p>The <strong>DEMANDERDS</strong> and <strong>SUPPLIERDS</strong> values can be the same, indicating that all the data
is in the same dataset.  In this case, <strong>GROUP</strong> must be used to distinguish the cases.
<strong>GROUP</strong> names a variable that indicates which are demander cases and which supplier ones.
A value of 1 indicates demander and 0 indicates supplier.  Any other values, including missing,
cause the case to be ignored.</p>

<p>This procedure builds some possibly large tables in memory, so it may not be appropriate for very
large datasets.</p>

<p>There are several output options.
The <strong>ID</strong> or IDs of matching cases are appended to the demander dataset variables.  The number of
variables listed as <strong>NEWDEMANDERIDVARS</strong> determines how many matches are attempted.  These variables
must not already exist in the demander dataset.</p>

<p>The variables in the supplier dataset that are listed in <strong>COPYTODEMANDER</strong> are copied to the 
demander dataset as new variables or replacement values.  For existing variables, the types 
must agree.  If no match is found, existing demander dataset values are not changed and new
variable values will be sysmis or blank.</p>

<p>COPYTODEMANDER cannot be used with GROUP.</p>

<p>Only one NEWDEMANDERIDVARS may be specified if COPYTODEMANDER is used.<br/>
None of the metadata such as variable and value labels is copied.  Use APPLY DICTIONARY 
to bring over variable properties.</p>

<p>If <strong>DS3</strong> is specified, a new dataset is created containing the cases in the supplier dataset actually 
used for the matches.  It will be the active dataset after the command is run.<br/>
DS3 cannot be used with GROUP.
(This implies that any unnamed dataset will be closed.)
It contains all the variables froom the supplier dataset plus the <strong>MATCHGROUPVAR</strong>.
If DEMANDERID is specified, it also contains the ID variable from the demander dataset.  These 
variable names must all be unique.
DS3 is only a dataset: use the SAVE command to turn it into a file.</p>

<p><strong>DRAWPOOLSIZE</strong> can name a variable for the demander dataset that will record the
number of cases in the supplier dataset that are eligible to match the demander case.
This can be useful in identifying the types of cases in terms of BY variables where
the supplier pool is thin.  The variable must not already exist in the demander dataset.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p>By default, sampling from the supplier dataset is done without replacement.  Specify
<strong>SAMPLEWITHREPLACEMENT</strong>=TRUE to sample with replacement.</p>

<p><strong>BEST</strong> specifies how to measure the quality of a potential match.
See the section below on the matching algorithm for details.</p>

<p><strong>MAXQUEUE</strong> specifies how to scale down the limit on
the maximum number of supplier candidates to consider for a demander.
It must be a positive fraction less than or equal to 1.
See the discussion below for details.</p>

<p>By default, cases in the demander dataset are processed in case order.  If there are insufficient 
supplier cases, you may specify <strong>SHUFFLE</strong>=TRUE to process the demander cases in random order.
This ensures that earlier cases do not have an advantage over later ones in matching.<br/>
SHUFFLE increases the memory requirement and will take longer to execute.</p>

<p>Use <strong>SEED</strong>=number to set the random number generator to a known state for repeatability.</p>

<h2>OUTFILE</h2>

<p>Matching can be quite time consuming.  Progress can be logged to a file during the run.
Specify a file/path as <strong>LOGFILE</strong>=&ldquo;filespec&rdquo; to record progress.
If <strong>LOGACCESSMODE</strong> is OVERWRITE, each run overwrites an existing file.  APPEND
appends to the log file.
The contents record the state the process has reached and writes the number of operations
completed at 1000 or 5000 case intervals for some operations.</p>

<h2>The Matching Algorithm</h2>
<p>
In this discussion, the two groups or files of cases are referred to as demanders and suppliers to avoid confusion with the term "case" as in case-control.</p>
<p>The goal of matching is to find for each demander case one or more supplier cases that are as similar to it as possible based on the match variables.  By default, the matching variable values must be exactly equal for a demander and supplier to match, but the user can specify a "fuzz" factor for each match variable that defines the maximum allowed absolute difference between demander and supplier.  Thus, when fuzz values are not specified, it is equivalent to specifying all the matching variable values to be identical.  Categorical variables, including all string variables, should have a fuzz of zero as difference distance is not meaningful.   If a match variable value is missing, that case is excluded from matches.</p>
<p>
The algorithm has two steps.  In the first step, each supplier case is associated with all the demander cases for which it is eligible, that is, for which the match variable differences are within the fuzz values, and a difference score is computed.  There are three options for computing the score.  Each computes the mean over the match variables for the demander case.  d(i) and s(i) are the values of the ith match variable for the demander and supplier cases.  The statistic options are.
<ul>
<li>PROPOR: abs(d(i) – s(i)) / (abs(d(i)) + abs(s(i)))</li>
<li>ABS: abs(d(i) – s(i))</li>
<li>SQUARED: (d(i) – s(i))**2</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the denominator in the first expression is zero, the expression is zero.  That could only happen if d(i) equals s(i).  The first option adjusts for differences in scale of the match variables.  If using either ABS or SQUARED, consider standardizing the match variables before matching.  If the fuzz values are all zero, i.e., exact match, all these formulas yield a zero mean.</p>

<p>The maximum length of the demander queue defaults to the number of demander cases times the
number of matches per case requested with the worst potential matches pruned as necessary.  This is
a worst-case limit.  It can be scaled down by the MAXQUEUE factor if memory usage is an issue.
</p>


<p>In the second step, for each demander case, the eligible suppliers with the smallest score are filtered to exclude cases already matched if sampling without replacement, and a supplier is picked at random from those cases.  If all the smallest-score supplier cases have already been used and sampling without replacement, the next best set of cases are selected, and the process is repeated and so on.  If all the eligible suppliers are exhausted, there is no match.  If more than one match is requested, the process is repeated with the remaining eligible cases, and the match quality value is the average over those cases.  All draws for a demander case are processed before moving on to the next case.  If a supplier case has been selected and sampling without replacement, it is not available for later matching.
</p>
<p>The output from matching includes a variable named matchdiff_ that holds the mean difference over the matches for each demander case.  Examining the distribution of this variable via a histogram or other measures is helpful in assessing the quality of the matches.  The output also includes statistics on the number of successful and failed matches and the distribution of available matches over the cases.  Other useful statistics would be comparisons of the distributions of the matching variables between the demander and supplier datasets.</p>

<p>NOTE: In versions of this command prior to 2.0, a different matching algorithm was used.  The current version will generally produce better matches.  The EXACTPRIORITY and MINIMIZEMEMORY keywords are no longer used: they can still appear in the syntax but will be ignored.  EXACTPRIORITY would be redundant because the current algorithm always takes the best match.</p>
